This directory contains all scripts necessary to generate all Main Text, Extended Data and Supplementary Figures, apart from the schematic portions of Main Text Figure 1, and schematic Figures S1, S2, and S3. It also contains the script that generates SI Tables 3 and 4.

These files can be generated by calling the individual scripts, or by calling the bash script "generate_all_figures.sh". This bash script contains annotations as to which script generates which figure, as well as usage examples. Note that the script titled "plot_simulated_wgs_results.py" calls the executable 'annotate_pvalues', which it expects to find in this directory. This executable annotates simulated metagenomic sequencing mutational trajectories with P-values, as described in SI section 7. The source code for this executable is the same as for the whole genome sequencing analysis, and can be found in the relevant directory.
