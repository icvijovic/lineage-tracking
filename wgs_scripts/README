## Analysis of metagenomic sequencing data

This folder contains all the scripts necessary to process raw fastq files output and produce allele frequency trajectories. Our approach to identify SNVs and small indels uses the breseq-lite scripts built to identify these variants in metagenomic sequence time-series data in E. coli (Good, McDonald, et. al.,(2017), Nature, 551:45-50), with modifications as described in SI section 7.

The sub-directory breseq_scripts contains scripts that process raw fastq files to call SNV's and small indels that satisfy basic quality filters. The breseq output is stored in ../data/wgs/cluster_output/. Each population has a file that contains trajectories of all SNVâ€™s and small indels called by breseq that satisfy basic quality filters (with roughly 100k lines per population). 

To do this, the following two scripts should be called:

'python process_cluster_output.py'	Removes variants that fall in repetitive regions of the genome, and calculates a p-value for the null model for every trajectory individually. Output stored in ../data/wgs/annotated/. Note that this script calls the executable 'annotate_pvalues', for which the source code can be located in the sub-directory trajectory_pvalue_cpp_code]

usage: python process_cluster_output.py

`filter_pvalue.py' Filters out all trajectories in ../../data/wgs/annotated/ with a p-value larger than PVALUE_THRESHOLD and stores the output in ../data/wgs/filtered/. Default PVALUE_THESHOLD is 0.05.

usage: python filter_pvalue.py [-pvalue_threshold PVALUE_THRESHOLD]
